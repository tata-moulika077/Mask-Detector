# 😷 Face Mask Detector

A real-time Face Mask Detection system using computer vision and deep learning, built with Python, OpenCV, and TensorFlow/Keras. The model detects whether people in a video stream are wearing face masks or not.

---

## 📌 Features

- Real-time mask detection using webcam
- Trained deep learning model using TensorFlow and Keras
- Haarcascade and CNN-based face detection
- Color-coded bounding boxes (Green = Mask, Red = No Mask)
- Easy-to-run script with webcam or image/video input support

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Haarcascade Classifier

## 📥 Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/avinashkranjan/Mask-Detector.git
cd Mask-Detector
````

2. **Install Required Libraries**

It's recommended to use a virtual environment.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If `requirements.txt` is missing, manually install:

```bash
pip install opencv-python tensorflow keras numpy matplotlib
```

## ▶️ How to Run

### Real-time detection from webcam:

```bash
python detect_mask_video.py
```

### Detection on an image:

```bash
python detect_mask_image.py --image path_to_image.jpg
```
